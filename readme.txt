--[ about ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

inhesion is a C library for searching, classifying, and morphing. It searches
for solutions to multivariable problems, infers classifications of unknown
objects, and morphs programs to adapt to their environments...or environments
to adapt to their users. To do this, inhesion uses complex systems, including
cellular automata and cultural evolutionary algorithms. inhesion was created by
Matthew Van Temple.

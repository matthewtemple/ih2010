--[ about ]--------------------------------------------------------------------

ih is a C library for searching, classifying, and morphing. It searches for
solutions to multivariable problems, infers classifications of unknown objects
and morphs programs to adapt to their environments...or environments to adapt
to their users. To do this, ih uses complex systems, including cellular
automata and cultural evolutionary algorithms. ih was created by Matthew Temple.
